    <p>What is a Cover Sheet? To print a book, you will need to submit two documents online: a Book Block and the Cover Sheet. The Cover Sheet document is the outside of the book. 
      This document contains the back cover, spine, and front cover as one solid sheet. 
      During the printing and binding process, the Cover Sheet is wrapped around the Book Block (interior pages) and the two parts are then bound together. 
      The cover can be printed in full color or black and white. 
      The Cover Sheet can be designed in Microsoft Publisher, Adobe Illustrator, or another desktop publishing software. 
      It is possible to create a very simple Cover Sheet using Microsoft Word. This document must be saved as a PDF/A file type.

      Creating the Cover Sheet:
    </h3><
      p> Like the Book Block page size, the Cover Sheet must have a defined page size before being saved as a PDF/A. 
      The Cover Sheet size depends on the final size of the book. 
      To properly layout and design the Cover Sheet so that it wraps around the Book Block, you will need to have finished writing and editing your Book Block. 
      This is because you will use the final page count of the Book Block to determine the width of your spine as well as the page size to determine the dimensions of the front and back covers. 
      The page count is the number of single-sided pages, including blank pages, between the cover of the book. Your page count will match the number of PDF pages of your Book Block file.</p>
    <p>Spine Width Calculation: Number of Pages in Book Block divided by PPI = Width of Spine in Inches</p>
    <p>Page = single side page</p>
    <p>PPI = pages per inch</p>
    <p>Premium White Paper PPI: 377</p>
    <p>Layout of Cover Sheet: You will layout your Cover Sheet centered on 11" x 17" paper with a landscape orientation. The back cover will be on the left, the spine in the center, and the front cover to the right.</p>
